		<p id="title"> Summer 2020 at Aon </p> 
        <p id="date"> 08/16/2020 </p>
        <p id="text"> Here's my interview and internship experience with Aon!</p> 

        <p id="head"> Aon </p>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p id="text"> Aon provides five services, one of which is Data & Analytic Services. Within Data & Analytic Services, they have the Cyber Solutions line. We have three large groups in there! </p>
            <ul id="text"> 
                <li> Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) </li>
                <li> Penetration Testing </li>
                <li> Technical Consulting</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="text"> Their LA office has a large DFIR team and two smaller Pen-Testing(lol p much non-existent) and Advisory teams. The DFIR team spends most of the time in office (bc they're handling/retrieving physical evidence) while the other two can work remotely.</p>
        </div>

        <p id="head"> The Interview Process </p>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p id="text"> There are two rounds of interviews. I had a very pleasant experience! It's honestly very non-technical; they just want to know how interested you are in cybersecurity and how you think out loud. </p>

            <ol id="text">
                <li> Apply for "Cyber Summer Associate" on website</li>
                <li> Complete a pre-recorded interview w infinite tries (behavioral) </li>
                <li> On-site interview in NYC with senior consultants, managers, and vice presidents (behavioral/technical)</li>
                <ul id="text">
                    <li> Behavioral </li>
                    <li> Scenario </li>
                    <li> Logical </li>
                    <li> Group </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Decision emailed/phoned  </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="subtext"> 
                <p id="text"> I had an unforgettable experience! Aon was veryyy accomodating. They arranged the flights and stay, reimbursed any cab fees, and organized a whole tour day. Besides hustling the interview, I had time to relax in my hotel and hangout some hometown friends :-) </p>

            </div>
            <p id="text"> Two weeks after my interview, I received a phone call with awesome news! </p>
        </div>

        <p id="head"> The Internship </p>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p id="text"> Soo of course Ms. Rona made this experience virtual, which had its own set of pros and cons. One thing is for sure, I was really looking forward to returning to NYC for the 3-day intern orientation followed by a CTF! </p> 
            <p id="text"> 8 Week Timeline </p>
            <div class="subtext"> 
                <p id="text"> Week 1: Orientation + IT set up</p>
                <p id="text"> Week 2: Receive CSA and Aon United project</p>
                <p id="text"> Week 4: Midpoint check up + feedback</p>
                <p id="text"> Week 8: Present projects</p>
            </div>
            <p id="text"> Most of your time is intended to be decided by you! Here's how I spent mine. </p>
            <div class="subtext"> 
                <p id="text"> 60% Working on Cyber Summer Associate Project w my partner from Washington D.C. </p>
                <p id="text"> 30% Examining cases and sitting on client calls </p>
                <p id="text"> 10% Networking/meeting w my manager or colleagues from different practices </p>
            </div>
            <p id="text"> I came in to learn about DFIR and Aon/Stroz Friedberg's culture.</p>
            <p id="text"> DFIR is flipping intense! </p>
            <div class="subtext">
                <p id="text"> My managers work overtime like crazy. The LA office historically works only in Digital Forensics (edisco) but we've been getting a lot of Incident Response (ransomware, threat hunts, business email compromises) cases recently.</p>
                <p id="text"> I'm ngl, my managers always seem sooo tired but it is rewarding work. You are paid bonuses for your overtime and you are stopping cyber crime! </p>
                <p id="text"> Windoze is everything. Lots of businesses use Windows = we report and remediate a lot of Windows machines. As a Linux gal, I heard so many unfamiliar words for forensic artifacts like shellbags, jumplists, userlists, and so on. Cyber CTF's help out! </p>
            </div>
            <p id="text"> Aon is lawful good. </p>
            <div class="subtext">
                <p id="text"> Aon believes in putting their employees and clients first. During 'rona, Aon did not fire anyone; ironically the company works counter cyclical to pandemics. With companies demanding how to insure and virtual attacks at a high, people were more busy than ever! Anyways, they cut senior lvl and above's paychecks by 20% but gave it back alongside a 5% bonus!</p>
                <p id="text"> We had three optional meetings per week that focus on professional and personal development. Topics range from like "Finance 101" to "How to ask for Feedback"! Wholesome stuff ya know. </p>
                <p id="text"> #AonUnited we have weekly and monthly meetings connecting different regions and practices together. West Coast DFIR Cyber Huddle is definitely my favorite one! </p>
            </div>
            <p id="text"> Some personal takeaways from my experience: </p>
            <ul id="text"> 
                <li> You're the boss of your own time! You're formally given 2 projects to complete in 8 weeks. People don't have time to see what you're up to everyday :p esp in a virtual environment.  </li>
                <li> Set your boundaries and expectations. Big for DFIR! </li>
                <li> Ask simple questions as they arise. I got stuck with the smallest problems in X-Ways and would wait til Mondays to ask. </li>
                <li> When networking, feel free to ask people advice on your projects. It's more than just a professional networking chat!  </li>
            </ul>
